# WeDream

Welcome to WeDream, an innovative solution designed to improve sleep for millions who struggle with rest and suffer its consequences.

## About WeDream

WeDream leverages gamification and social networking to motivate users to develop disciplined and regular sleep routines. Our accessible iOS app, combined with real-time accurate sleep data from advanced health wearables like Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch, aims to transform how people approach sleep and overall well-being.

### The Problem

Sleep deprivation is a widespread issue, expected to worsen as distractions increase. Despite understanding sleep's benefits, many find it challenging to maintain a healthy night routine. Many of our schoolmates have expressed concerns about getting sufficient high-quality sleep, noting difficulties with productivity and concentration in class.

### Our Solution

Inspired by the engaging features of Duolingo, WeDream motivates users to stay committed to improving their sleep habits. We are dedicated to empowering individuals who actively seek to improve their daily lives and become the best versions of themselves.

## Features

- **Gamification**: Earn rewards and track your progress as you develop healthier sleep habits.
- **Social Networking**: Connect with friends and share your achievements to stay motivated.
- **Real-Time Sleep Data**: Access accurate sleep data from advanced health wearables like Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch.
- **User-Friendly iOS App**: An intuitive interface that makes it easy to track and improve your sleep routine.

## Getting Started

The project has not been entirely completed so it will not be released to Apple Store, but for your own interest feel free to clone the repo and open the project with XCode. You can build it locally with an iOS simulator and test our existing features for inspiration! Here are a few points to note:

- **Firebase**: If you are not allowed to access the original database connected due to various reasons such as security rule conflict, please modify the app setup file to connect to your own database.
- **Leaderboard**: For your convenience, we have attached a version of the Cloud Functions as localhost. Please open the folder with an appropriate editor (e.g. VS Code) and run the "index.js" file inside the "firebase-server" folder.
- **Firebase Authentication**: We are not responsible for any data leakage and the security of your information. Please do not create an account with a password that you use for other services.

## Documentation
As this project is part of our Grade 12 Computer Science Course, we have attached these documents for high school visitors to learn more about our project and potentially apply our experience in your ICS4U project in the future. Inside the first document, you will also be able to see photos that demonstrate certain features of the app.
